# THINGS TO DISCUSS

- How many rounds? Using the logic I used to build the scenarios
    - 66 rounds + 4 practice rounds (Best for power, maybe too long)
    - 54 + 3 (A bit less of power, less variation within participants)
- The value of the sustainability attribute is very similar to the value of the quality attribute (money-wise).
    - This is the least amount of trees I can use to have convex and concave treatments
- Should labels be equal in the different contexts? or just similar. 
    - Label 2 in concave is -1 of label 3
    - label 2 in conves is +1 of label 1
