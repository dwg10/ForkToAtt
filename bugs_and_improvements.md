THIS TEXT FILE IS FOR KEEPING RECORD OF CURRENT BUGS AND SUGGESTED IMPROVEMENTS


# To Do:
> Change treatments (less trials)
    > Check that treatments were constructed properly
    > Uncomment the randomize
> Change instructions, decision pages for row reveal
> Change Sustainability and Quality to points
> Change name in Heroku for so it doesn't say eco-task

# BUGS 



# THINGS TO DISCUSS

- The value of the sustainability attribute is very similar to the value of the quality attribute (money-wise).
    - This is the least amount of trees I can use to have convex and concave treatments
- Should labels be equal in the different contexts? or just similar. 
    - Label 2 in concave is -1 of label 3
    - label 2 in conves is +1 of label 1
