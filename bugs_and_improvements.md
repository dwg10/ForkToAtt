THIS TEXT FILE IS FOR KEEPING RECORD OF CURRENT BUGS AND SUGGESTED IMPROVEMENTS


# IMPROVEMENTS

    ## Decision

    - Create in between page with 

    ## Others

    - Questionnaire: previous button (nextSlide function need to be changed for this to work)

    - Instructions: get slide texts, questions, dots from object instead of hardcoded

    - put objects in JSON files

    - input fields and radiobuttons sizing is a little bit off with big screen.  

# BUGS 


> Questionnaire: progress bar moves together with autocomplete dropdown menu. It should flow over it without the progress bar moving anywhere

> Instructions: slide 7 (questions) "jumps" down. Something wrong with container placement

> Infographic: when Next button appears on Slide 3, the dots stop working (cannot switch slide with them anymore). Probably something to do with the placing of the button.
