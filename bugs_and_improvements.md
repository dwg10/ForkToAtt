THIS TEXT FILE IS FOR KEEPING RECORD OF CURRENT BUGS AND SUGGESTED IMPROVEMENTS


# To Do:

    ## CSS 

    - Change the font-sizes to em not vw or vh. 
    - Change alignment of text to 'justified'
    
    ## Introduction

    - Add UvA Logo to introduction page. 

    ## Instructions

    - (AH) Change AvgDur, NN trials and Max Bonus in constants for lay-out
    - (AH) Add Overall Iddle Time-out
    - Change number of practice trials to : How many decisions will be chosen for payment?
    - Write down Right (Left) arrow button (or press 'Left(right) arrow symbol'). Once any of them is pressed, the parenthesis should dissappear.

    ## Practice Trials
    - (AH) Add Practice trials

    ## Decision

    - (AH) Choose prices
    - Change lay-out button in Between.html

    ## Infographics
    - Change the order of first slide depending on what is presented first and after. (i.e. if order is leaves and stars, the first slide says stars and leaves. This can be confusing.)
    - Add check-up questions in infographic. 
        1. If you get a product with 3 leaves (symbol), what is the maximum amount of trees that can be planted?
        2. If you get a product with 2 stars, what is the minimum amount of points you can get?
    - Add a page, now we are going to proceed with the experiment. (and next button)

    ## Questionnaire

    - Write down below button (or press 'Enter'). Once it's pressed, the parenthesis should dissappear. 
    - (AH) Add end-page with payment

    ## Others (Are these still issues?)

    - Questionnaire: previous button (nextSlide function need to be changed for this to work)

    - Instructions: get slide texts, questions, dots from object instead of hardcoded

    - put objects in JSON files

    - input fields and radiobuttons sizing is a little bit off with big screen.  

# BUGS 

(Are these still an issue?)

> Instructions: Size of the screen is more than 100vw, then when I press left or right the whole page moves. This can be a bit distracting. 

> Questionnaire: progress bar moves together with autocomplete dropdown menu. It should flow over it without the progress bar moving anywhere

> Instructions: slide 7 (questions) "jumps" down. Something wrong with container placement

> Infographic: when Next button appears on Slide 3, the dots stop working (cannot switch slide with them anymore). Probably something to do with the placing of the button.
