        <ul>
            <li> Upon the start of the experiment, information on the values of the balls will be shared.</li>
            <li> Each colour indicates a certain value. For example: </li>
            <ul>
                <li> <img class="img-info" src="{% static 'global/figures/Blue.png' %}" />: A blue ball has a value of 5. </li>
                <li> <img class="img-info" src="{% static 'global/figures/Red.png' %}" />: A red ball has a value of 2. </li>
                <li> <img class="img-info" src="{% static 'global/figures/Yellow.png' %}" />: A yellow ball has a value of 1. </li>
            </ul>
            <li> This would mean that a blue ball is worth more than a red ball and a yellow ball, 
            whilst a red ball would be worth more than a yellow ball.</li>
            <li> The total value of all balls of one colour can be calculated by multiplying the number of balls of that colour with the relevant value of that colour. </li>
            <li> In the example, this would mean that the red balls in the first basket have a total value of 40 x 2 = 80.</li>
            <li> Adding these total values for all three colours within a basket will give you the total value of a basket. </li>
            <li> In the example, this would mean that the first basket has a total value of (4 x 5) + (40 x 2) + (10 x 1) = 110.</li>
            <li> <u>Note:</u> The value of each colour will only be shared <b>once!</b> Make sure that you know these upon starting the experiment.</li>
            <li> In the next slide, we will explain more about the decision process.</li>
