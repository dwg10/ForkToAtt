            <li> The total value of all balls of one colour can be calculated by multiplying the quantity of balls of that colour with the relevant value. </li>
            <li> In this example, this would mean that the red balls in the first basket have a total value of <i> quantity x value = 40 x 2 = 80.</i></li>
            <li> Adding these total values for all three colours within a basket will give you the total value of a basket. </li>
            <li> In the example, this would mean that the first basket has a total value of (4 x 5) + (40 x 2) + (10 x 1) = 110.</li>
            <li> The second basket has a total value of (10 x 5) + (24 x 2) + (2 x 1) = 100.</li>
            <li> This means that the first basket is more valuable than the second basket.</li>
            <li> In the next slide, we will explain more about the decision process.</li>
