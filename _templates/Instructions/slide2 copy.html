            <li> Make multiple decisions between baskets in (<b>{{ Constants.NumTrials }} rounds</b>).</li>
            <li> In each round, you will see <b>2 baskets</b> and their contents.</li>
            <li> The number of balls of each colour is displayed in the relevant cell for each basket.</li>
            <li> For example, the number of red balls in the second basket equals 24.</li>
            <li> Furthermore, basket 1 has 10 balls in the example decision situation.</li>
